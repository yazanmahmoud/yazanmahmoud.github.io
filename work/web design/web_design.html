        <h2>Web Design Projects</h2>
        <p>I created several websites for various businesses, including a pizza restaurant (La Familia), multiple limousine services (Bright Star Limo, Airtime Limo, Presidential Limo), and an e-commerce store (Maritime Savers) that sold items such as bongs, t-shirts, purses, and ball caps.
            Unfortunately, many of these businesses were forced to shut down or sell due to the impact of COVID-19.</p>
        <p>To fulfill the requirements for my college degree, during my work placement I developed a mock version of a live website, updated and cleaned HTML code, fixed broken links, and made minimal enhancements to the existing CSS. 
            I built it using React JS application and JavaScript, and I also added the time, date and weather, for AI-enhanced features. 
            I then pushed the project to a new GitHub repository and deployed it using GitHub Pages.</p>
